# Competitive Hebbian Learning through Spike-Timing-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity

This repository contains an implementation of the model presented in the paper:

**Song, S., Miller, K. D., & Abbott, L. F. (2000). "Competitive Hebbian learning through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity." Nature Neuroscience, 3(9), 919â€“926.**

## Overview

Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons based on the precise timing of spikes. This paper presents a model where competitive Hebbian learning emerges from STDP, demonstrating how this mechanism can lead to the development of neural selectivity and complex network dynamics.

This repository provides a reimplementation of the key experiments and simulations presented in the paper, using modern tools and frameworks.

## Repository Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the model implementation, input generation, and analysis.
- **Experiment.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for step-by-step explanations and visualizations of the experiments.
